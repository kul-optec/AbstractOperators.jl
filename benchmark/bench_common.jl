# Shared infrastructure and fixtures for the benchmark suites.
#
# `benchmarks.jl` is the entry point AirspeedVelocity loads: it includes this file, then every
# suite in `suites/`, then finalises the sampling parameters. Each suite can also be run on
# its own, which is the point of the split -- a change to one operator family does not require
# paying for the whole suite:
#
#     julia --project=benchmark benchmark/suites/linearoperators.jl
#     OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 julia --project=benchmark -t 8 benchmark/suites/calculus.jl
#
# What belongs here: the subpackage probes, the threading gate, the size constants, and the
# state builders used by more than one suite. A state builder used by exactly one suite lives
# in that suite's file.

	BENCH_THREADED

Whether to register the multithreaded variants of the benchmarks.

Follows `Threads.nthreads() > 1`: skipped at one thread, where every operator's policy
vetoes threading and a "threaded" entry would merely re-measure the serial path under a
misleading name. `compare.jl` pins the worker's thread count explicitly with `-t` for each
pass (see `run_suite`), running the suite once per thread count in `--threads` and
reporting each as its own comparison section -- so "how many threads were live" is a
controlled axis of the measurement, not incidental runner state, and single- and
multithreaded numbers are never mixed into one ambiguous run.

A shared CI runner's execution-time jitter still affects the threaded numbers, same as it
already does the serial ones; accepted as a known source of noise in exchange for
measuring both regimes at all.

Override with `ABSTRACTOPERATORS_BENCH_THREADED=true|false` to force a value regardless of
`Threads.nthreads()` -- e.g. to register the threaded entries while smoke-testing at `-t 1`.

Return `op`, first asserting that the threading policy actually granted it threading.

`threaded = true` is a *permission*, not a command: each operator's policy may still veto
it because the workload is below that operator's measured crossover, because there are
fewer blocks than `MIN_BLOCKS_FOR_PARALLEL`, or because the storage is not CPU-backed. A
benchmark that asks for threading and silently gets the serial path is worse than no
benchmark at all -- it reports a "threaded" number that never exercised a thread, and would
keep reporting it after a threading regression. Every threaded entry below routes its
operator through here so that mis-sizing fails loudly instead.

true when the blocks happen to thread internally even though the block loop runs serially.

Evaluations per sample for the threaded entries.

`setup` builds a fresh domain/codomain pair for every sample, so at `evals = 1` each timed
call pays first-touch page faults on several MB of newly allocated memory. That cost is
serial-ish in the kernel and swamps the parallel win: DiagOp's threaded forward measured a
median 4.15x its own minimum and came out *slower* than the serial path it beats by 8x once
the buffers are warm. Amortising over 50 evaluations reuses the buffers within a sample and
brings the spread down to 1.5x, with the minimum matching a standalone hot-loop measurement.

Applied only to the threaded entries: the serial ones keep `evals = 1` so their recorded
baselines stay comparable across this change.

Per-leaf `seconds` cap: `1.0` in the single-thread regime, `0.5` in the multithreaded one

single-thread pass is the primary regression signal and gets the larger budget (more
samples); the multithreaded pass is comparative/confirmatory and gets less.

`compare.jl` runs the full suite once per thread count in `--threads`, and once each for
base and head, so a naive `leaves * seconds` estimate undercounts the real CI cost badly:
several suites (`fftwoperators`, `waveletoperators`, `normaloperators`, `nfftoperators`)
are dominated by per-sample setup cost (FFTW `MEASURE` planning, NFFT/wavelet init) that a
lower `seconds` cannot shrink -- a single sample there can already exceed the cap. If CI
timing drifts, re-measure end to end with:
`compare.jl --base-dir X --head-dir X --threads 1,2` timed with the same checkout as both
base and head (or, per-thread-count only:
`julia -t N --project=benchmark -e 'using BenchmarkTools; include("benchmark/benchmarks.jl"); @time BenchmarkTools.run(SUITE; verbose=true)'`).
