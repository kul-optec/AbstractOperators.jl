	NFFTOp(image_size::NTuple{D,Int}, trajectory::AbstractArray{T}, dcf::AbstractArray; threaded::Bool=true, kwargs...)

Create a non-uniform fast Fourier transform operator [1]. The operator is created with a given image 
size, trajectory, and density compensation function (dcf). The dcf is used to correct for the 
non-uniform sample density of the trajectory. The operator can be used to transform images to 
k-space and back.

<em>To use the operator, the NFFT package must be explicitly imported!</em>

# Arguments
- `image_size::NTuple{D,Int}`: The size of the image to transform.
- `trajectory::AbstractArray{T}`: The trajectory of the samples in k-space. The first dimension
  of the trajectory must match the number of image dimensions. The trajectory must have at least
  two dimensions.
- `dcf::AbstractArray`: The density compensation function. The shape of the trajectory from the
  second dimension must match the shape of the dcf array. The element type of the trajectory must
  match the element type of the dcf array. This argument is optional and defaults to `nothing`.
  If `nothing` is passed, the dcf will be estimated using the sample density compensation method [2].
- `threaded::Bool=true`: `false` disables threading outright; `true` (the default) enables it subject to the threading policy, which also requires more than one Julia thread and CPU storage. Fixed at construction, since the NFFT plan is built for a thread count.
- `dcf_estimation_iterations::Union{Nothing,Int}=nothing`: The number of iterations to use when
  estimating the dcf. Defaults to `20`. This argument is only used if `dcf` is not provided.
- `dcf_correction_function::Function=identity`: A correction function to apply to the estimated dcf.
  Defaults to the identity function. This argument is only used if `dcf` is not provided.
- `kwargs...`: Additional keyword arguments to pass to the NFFTPlan constructor.

"""
Minimum Julia thread count before NFFT's threaded path is worth entering.

Unlike every other operator in this package, NFFT's gate is on the *thread count* rather
than on the workload size, because that is what the measurement says decides it.

PROVENANCE: measured. AMD EPYC 7352 (shared), Julia 1.12.7, ComplexF64, 2D trajectory with
`nsamp = s`, `nprof = s ÷ 2`, one process per thread count. Ratios are serial/threaded, so
above 1 means threading wins:

| threads | 48^2 fwd / normal | 96^2 fwd / normal | 192^2 fwd / normal |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 0.59 / 0.85 | 0.78 / 0.99 | 0.91 / 0.90 |
| 3 | 0.87 / 0.81 | 1.03 / 1.07 | 2.29 / 1.41 |
| 4 | 0.87 / 0.96 | 1.93 / 1.56 | 1.43 / 2.21 |

At two workers threading is a loss at *every* size measured, up to a 5 ms `mul!` -- growing
the workload does not rescue it, which is why a size threshold is not the lever this needs.
From three workers up the wins appear and grow with size, so three is the gate.

The 48^2 column stays at or below 1.0 at every thread count and is the obvious candidate for
an additional size gate. It is deliberately *not* added: a repeat of the four-thread run put
48^2 at 1.20 / 1.18 instead, so on this shared machine that column is inside the noise and a
threshold fitted to it would not be measurement, only curve-fitting. The two-thread row, by
contrast, reproduces. Adjoint ratios are omitted from the table for the same reason -- they
ranged from 0.57 to 1.10 across repeats of the same configuration.

The threaded path also allocates 4-12 KiB per `mul!` (FFTW's Julia threading backend spawns
tasks per execution) against 112 B for the serial one, so below the gate it was paying that
for a slowdown. Leaving the gate at `nthreads() > 1` cost 0.63x on the two-thread
`normaloperators/NFFTOp/mul` benchmark with an 18x allocation increase.

	_nfft_threaded(threaded, arr_wrapper) -> Bool

Resolve NFFT's `threaded` keyword under the package-wide rule: `false` vetoes, `true`
enables subject to policy (see `AbstractOperators._resolve_threaded`).

The policy here is the CPU check plus [`MIN_THREADS_FOR_NFFT`](@ref). There is deliberately
**no size gate**: the transform is planned for a specific trajectory rather than a plain
array length, so there is no single element count to threshold on -- and the sweep behind
`MIN_THREADS_FOR_NFFT` shows size is not what decides it anyway.

Run `f()` with NFFT's, BLAS's and FFTW's threading turned on or off together.

`threaded = true` actively *enables* them rather than merely leaving them alone, because
`NFFT._use_threads[]` defaults to off and is what the NFFT plan consults. Both directions
go through `NestedThreading`, so the request is clamped by any outer budget: an operator
constructed with `threaded = true` that ends up being called from inside a saturated batch
loop stays single-threaded, and the save/restore bookkeeping is refcounted rather than
