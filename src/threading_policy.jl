# ─── Thresholds ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# There is deliberately no single global constant: the size at which threading starts to
# pay depends on how much work each element costs.
#
# The thresholds come in two layers:
#
#   1. The cost-class constants below (`THRESHOLD_*`). These are the *defaults* and the
#      documentation of each class's shape. An operator that has not been swept
#      individually falls back to one of them.
#   2. Per-operator `threading_threshold(::Type{Op})` methods, each a transcription of that
#      operator's own crossover from `benchmark/operator_thresholds.jl`.
#
# Layer 2 is what governs in practice, and it is not cosmetic: measuring each operator's
# real `mul!` showed the cost classes are too coarse. Within the "transcendental" class the
# measured crossovers span 2^8 (SoftPlus) to 2^11 (integer Pow) -- an 8x spread. `Pow` even
# splits internally, since a fractional exponent lowers to `exp(p*log(x))` and crosses over
# three powers of two earlier than an integer one. Sharing one constant across a class would
# leave most of its members either threading too early or not early enough.
#
# Each constant carries a PROVENANCE line stating where its value came from. Values marked
# `measured` are transcriptions of a `benchmark/threading_sweep.jl` run whose machine and
# thread count are named; values marked `provisional` are order-of-magnitude starting
# points that the sweep has not yet confirmed. Never promote provisional -> measured
# without re-running the sweep and pasting its crossover.
#
# Measurement context for the `measured` values below:
#   AMD EPYC 7352 24-Core (96 logical), 8 Julia threads, OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1, 2026-08-15
#   Julia 1.12.6 (see Manifest.toml's `julia_version`)
#   `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 julia --project=benchmark -t 8 benchmark/threading_sweep.jl`
# Each threshold takes the *more conservative* of the Float64 and Float32 crossovers, so a
# threshold is never below the point where the narrower element type still pays.
#
# The sweep also settled the kernel choice per class, and it did not match the starting
# hypothesis everywhere -- see `THRESHOLD_MEMORY_BOUND`.

Transcendental elementwise kernels (`Sin`, `Cos`, `Exp`, `Atan`, `Tanh`, `Sech`, `Sigmoid`,
`SoftPlus`, `Pow` with non-integer exponent). Each element costs tens of ns, so the thread
launch overhead is amortized early. Kernel: FastBroadcast `@..` with `thread = true`.

PROVENANCE: measured. `transcendental` sweep, `@..` crossover n = 1024 (Float64) and

`thread = true`.

these two kernel shapes share one constant.

batch loop usually has far more items than a DCAT has blocks, so the per-item overhead is

or in a single-threaded session all yield `is_threaded(L) == false`, because in each case
threading would not happen (or would be a pessimisation). See `_resolve_threaded`
for the full rule.

Consequently `is_threaded(copy_operator(L; threaded = true))` is **not** guaranteed to be
`true`; `is_threaded(copy_operator(L; threaded = false))` *is* guaranteed to be `false`,
which is the direction nesting safety depends on.

Defaults to `false`.
"""
is_threaded(::AbstractOperator) = false

"""
	_resolve_threaded(policy, threaded::Bool) -> Bool

The single place the `threaded` keyword is interpreted, so that every operator in the
package answers it the same way.

The keyword is a `Bool` — there is no third state:

| value | meaning |
|---|---|
| `false` | **veto.** Never thread. This is the only hard directive, and it has to be, because nesting safety depends on it: a threaded batch/block loop switches its children off with `threaded = false` and must be able to rely on that. |
| `true` (default) | **permission.** Threading is enabled *if the policy also agrees*. It does not force threading on. |

`true` being a permission rather than a command is what lets the policy keep the final say
for correctness reasons (a kernel that is only valid for certain shapes; GPU storage, where
Julia-level threading only adds overhead; a single-threaded session) and for performance
reasons (below the operator's measured crossover, threading is a slowdown). It also keeps
`is_threaded` honest: it reports what the operator will actually do, never what was merely
asked for.

To force threading on regardless of size — for a benchmark, say — call the constructor with
a size above the operator's `threading_threshold`, or lower that threshold; there is
deliberately no override that makes `is_threaded` disagree with the executed path.

!!! note
    `copy_operator` and `adapt_operator` also take a `threaded` keyword, and there it *does*
    accept `nothing`. That is a different axis: those are **constraint** arguments, where
    `nothing` means "no constraint on threading, preserve what the operator has", exactly as
    `storage_type = nothing` means "no constraint on storage". Without it, a plain

while `threaded = false` is a **demand** ("do not spawn threads", required for nesting
safety). Without the distinction, passing `threaded = true` down a `Compose` to a

# Unlike FFTW/NFFT, BLAS has no plan: its thread count is a live, process-global setting
# that `gemv!`/`gemm!` reads on every call, exactly like the elementwise kernels above.
# `MatrixOp`/`LMatrixOp` therefore scope it per call rather than baking a count in at
# construction.
#
# BLAS is the one pool here that is *not* a Julia thread pool: it owns its own workers and
# already applies its own internal size heuristic (OpenBLAS' `GEMM_MULTITHREAD_THRESHOLD`
# and friends) to decide whether a given `gemv`/`gemm` is worth splitting. That has two
# consequences the elementwise policy above does not share, and getting either wrong costs
# roughly a factor of two on a plain `MatrixOp` `mul!`:
#
#   1. There is no `Threads.nthreads() > 1` precondition. A session started with `-t 1`
#      still has a fully threaded BLAS, and pinning it to one thread there is a pure loss
#      (measured: a 192x192 `gemm` takes 352 us at one BLAS thread against 187 us at four).
#   2. There is no element-count threshold of our own. Adding one only duplicates -- badly,
#      since we see `length(A)` rather than the actual `m*n*k` FLOP count -- a decision BLAS
#      already makes per call.
#
# So `threaded = true` means "leave BLAS at its own budget" and costs nothing at all, while
# `threaded = false` is the veto that nesting safety depends on and is the only case that
# opens a scope. The veto goes through NestedThreading's refcounted budget scope
# (`with_restricted_threads`), not a raw `BLAS.set_num_threads` save/restore: a `mul!` can
# run concurrently with other `mul!`s (e.g. several `MatrixOp` blocks inside a threaded
# `HCAT`/`VCAT` block loop), and a naive save/restore of a process-global from concurrent
# callers is exactly the interleaving bug NestedThreading exists to prevent.

"""
	_with_blas_threading(f, threaded::Bool)

Run `f()` with BLAS restricted to a single thread when `threaded` is `false`, or with BLAS
left at whatever budget is in force when it is `true`.

The permitted branch deliberately opens **no** scope. Any outer `NestedThreading`
restriction is process-global and already applied by the time it is reached, so re-asserting
it would only add a lock and a round trip through every registered pool's setter to each
`mul!` -- measured at ~5.5 us per scope, which is not a rounding error for an operator whose
whole job may be a few microseconds of `gemv`: `calculus/Ax_mul_Bx/forward` wraps two
`MatrixOp`s and paid 28.6 -> 34.1 us for exactly those two scopes.

A `with_full_threads` here would additionally *raise* BLAS past a count the caller had
deliberately set, which the `with_thread_budget` docstring calls out as the one thing a
full-throttle scope does that a plain call does not.

!!! note "What BLAS's own budget actually is"
    `LinearAlgebra.__init__` sets it to `max(1, jl_effective_threads() ÷ 2)` — driven by the
    machine and by CPU affinity, and **never** by Julia's `-t`. A `-t 1` session still gets a
    multi-threaded BLAS, which is exactly why gating on `Threads.nthreads()` was wrong.

    Two situations leave it at 1 through no fault of this package, and `threaded = true` then
    stays at 1 rather than raising it:

    - fewer than four effective CPUs (`jl_effective_threads() ÷ 2 == 1`);
    - a `Distributed` worker, where `Distributed` calls `Base.disable_library_threading()`,
      whose registered hook is `BLAS.set_num_threads(1)`.

    Both are deliberate policy from outside this package — the second especially, since a
    worker process is expected not to oversubscribe the node — so it is not this function's
    business to override them. A caller who wants otherwise sets `BLAS.set_num_threads`
    themselves; setting `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` also works, but note it makes LinearAlgebra

"""
	adapt_operator(op; storage_type=nothing, threaded=nothing, require_thread_safe=false)

Return an operator equivalent to `op` that satisfies the requested constraints, **without
copying when `op` already satisfies them**.

This is the counterpart to [`copy_operator`](@ref), which always produces a new object:

- `adapt_operator` returns `op` itself (`===`) when every requested constraint already
  holds, and delegates to `copy_operator` otherwise.
- `threaded = false` is a constraint that can always be met. `threaded = true` is a
  *permission* (see `_resolve_threaded`), so a copy made for it may still come back
  serial if the policy declines — asking twice will not change that.
- Use `adapt_operator` when you need *an* operator meeting a constraint (the common case
  when wrapping child operators); use `copy_operator` when you need a *distinct* object,
  e.g. one private copy per thread.

`require_thread_safe` demands `is_thread_safe(op)` before `op` may be returned as-is.

!!! warning
    `require_thread_safe` can only ever *withhold* the sharing fast path — it cannot
    manufacture thread safety. Thread safety is a property of an operator's type (does its
    `mul!` write into operator-owned buffers?), and copying an operator that keeps internal
    scratch buffers yields another operator that keeps internal scratch buffers. So when
    `is_thread_safe(op)` is `false`, this returns a **copy that is still not thread-safe**.

    Callers that need to run an operator concurrently must therefore branch on
    `is_thread_safe` themselves: share one instance when it is `true`, and allocate one
    private copy per thread when it is `false`. See `create_BatchOp` for that pattern.
